CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development


What have I learnt?

I learnt about the different positions in web development, like what a front end developer is and does....
I learnt about Github and how to work Github Desktop and VS Code

CSS references and how to apply them to make pages look OK.

That mimo is indispensible to stand any chance of following what is happening.

I need lots of practice time to get familiar with what Alex is on about.

How did I use this in practice?
Just learning and playing with it



What did I find hard?
Trying to keep up with the speed of the lessons because the modules are all messed up.
Trying to understand all the subtleties of what the refernces do and how they interplay.
Failing to understand what the various technobabble terms mean - relative???
